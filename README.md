E-commerce Product Recommendation Engine
1. Project Overview
This project implements a collaborative filtering recommendation engine for an e-commerce dataset. The goal is to predict and suggest products that a user is likely to be interested in based on their purchase history and the behavior of similar users.
The project demonstrates two primary collaborative filtering approaches:
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items by finding users with similar purchase histories.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items that are similar to items a user has already purchased.
The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, leveraging the pandas library for data manipulation and the scikit-surprise library for building and evaluating the recommendation models.
2. Dataset
The project uses the Online Retail Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is also available on Kaggle. This dataset contains transactional data from a UK-based online retail store between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011.
Source: E-commerce Data on Kaggle
File: ecommerce-data.csv
Attributes: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country.
For the purpose of this recommendation engine, we treat a user's purchase of an item as an implicit rating. The Quantity of the purchase is used as the rating value.
3. Requirements & Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3 and the libraries listed below.
Libraries:
pandas
scikit-surprise
jupyter notebook
You can install all the necessary dependencies using pip:
code
Bash
pip install pandas scikit-surprise notebook
4. How to Use
Clone the Repository:
code
Bash
git clone [your-repository-link]
cd [your-repository-directory]
Place the Dataset:
Download the ecommerce-data.csv file from the Kaggle link above and place it in the root directory of the project.
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:
code
Bash
jupyter notebook
Run the Notebook:
Open the .ipynb file and execute the cells sequentially to see the data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and final recommendations.
5. Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
a. Data Loading and Cleaning
The dataset is loaded using pandas.
Data is cleaned by:
Removing transactions with missing CustomerID.
Filtering out returned items (i.e., transactions with Quantity <= 0).
Converting CustomerID to the correct integer type.
b. Data Preprocessing and Filtering
To reduce noise and improve model performance, the dataset is filtered to include only:
Users who have purchased at least 5 different items.
Items that have been purchased by at least 5 different users.
The cleaned data is then transformed into the required (userID, itemID, rating) format for the surprise library.
c. Model Implementation
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: The KNNBasic algorithm from surprise is configured with user_based=True. It uses cosine similarity to find the nearest neighbors (most similar users) to generate predictions.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: The same KNNBasic algorithm is used, but configured with user_based=False. It computes similarities between items to make recommendations.
d. Evaluation
The models are evaluated using Precision@k and Recall@k, where k=10.
Precision@k: What proportion of the top-k recommended items are actually relevant to the user? This measures the accuracy of the recommendations.
Recall@k: What proportion of all relevant items did the model manage to recommend in the top-k list? This measures the model's ability to cover items the user likes.
6. Project Deliverables
The repository contains the following key deliverables as required by the assignment:
Jupyter Notebook: A .ipynb file with the complete, commented code for both filtering approaches and their evaluations.
